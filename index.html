                        <h3 style="color:darkorchid">With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) images on the rise, the question of what constitutes real art has began to 
                            spark discussions around the nature of human creativity. With the increasing disregard for the arts, literature, and the humanities as a whole, 
                            the use of technochonlofy to replace such an intimate expression of the human condition is a greater symptom of a long in process culture shift that devalues these disciplines while putting the sciences on a pedestal, 
                            yet forgets in the same breath that these very fields are the basis for all knowledge. 
                            Can such things really be handed off to machines, designed only through logic and learing to create what it has been trained to assign as pleasing, when art has long been subjective? 
                            This site hopes to bring attention to some of the most taleneted artists, past and present, in hopes of toying with a question on the rise with AI. 
                            What is art and can it be separated from its inherit humanity?</h3>
